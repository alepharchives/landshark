 Development Workflow

App Testing
===========

Recommendations:

- Use ``make shell`` to start your application
- Update the ``ERL_OPTS`` variable in ``Dependencies`` to include `-s` flags
  for starting procsses (e.g. your application, ``reloader``, etc.)
- Use Mochiweb's outstanding ``reloader`` module to detect changes in your code
  and automatically reload the changed modules.
- Generally, using ``io:format/2`` is faster than setting up the Erlang
  debugger, though the debugger is useful for tough cases.
