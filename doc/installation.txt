Not-Really Installation
=======================

Landshark doesn't have a proper installation routine at the moment.

For a "not really" installation, grab both Mochiweb and Landshark from github,
installing them into a common root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone http://github.com/mochi/mochiweb.git
   git clone http://github.com/gar1t/landshark.git

Make each project:

.. code-block:: bash

   make -C mochiweb
   make -C landshark

When modifying the `Dependencies` file (see :doc:`quickstart`), include the
respective paths to these two libraries.

.. note::

   To keep things simple, create any Landshark projects (using the ``empty``
   project skeleton) in the same top level directory -- the make files are
   setup to look there for dependencies.
