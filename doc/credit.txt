Credit
======

Landshark has borrowed liberally from several ground breaking projects in
Erlang and Python.

Mochiweb
========

  HTTP server 
    Landshark's outstanding performance characteristics are 100% attributed to
    Moahiweb's HTTP server.

WSGI
====

The application interface used by Landshark is derrived from WSGI 2.0.

  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333
    This is the original PEP that defined the WSGI standard.

  http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/WSGI_2.0
    This is the working specification of the 2.0 version.

METAL
=====

  http://wiki.zope.org/ZPT/METAL
    METAL inspired the :doc:`slots <slots>` design.

SNL
