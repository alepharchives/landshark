To run examples, first examine the paths used in src/Dependencies.in. If they
aren't correct, copy that file to src/Dependencies and modify the new file.

Once the paths to Mochiweb and Landshark are correct, run a single example
application as follows:

  make MOD=<module> run

For example, to run the src/hello.erl example:

  make MOD=hello run
